# Space Entity Recognition with Python in Google Colab

## Overview
This project is a Python-based implementation for Space Entity Recognition. It can be run in Google Colab, making it accessible and easy to use. Space Entity Recognition is the process of identifying and extracting named entities related to space, such as planets, stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects, from a given text or dataset.

- Google Account (for using Google Colab)
- Basic knowledge of Python and Jupyter notebooks

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab.
   - Upload the provided notebook file or create a new notebook.

3. Install any necessary dependencies if not already installed. Common libraries for NLP and machine learning are often required.

4. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to use the Space Entity Recognition script.

## Usage
Provide clear instructions on how to use your Space Entity Recognition script in Google Colab. Include details on how to input data, run the code, and interpret the results. Mention any customization options and parameters users can modify.

## Example
Include an example section that demonstrates how to use the script. You can provide sample code and input data and show the expected output.

```python
# Example code to use the Space Entity Recognition script
from space_entity_recognition import space_entity_recognizer

text = "The Hubble Space Telescope captured stunning images of the Andromeda Galaxy."
entities = space_entity_recognizer(text)
print(entities)
```
